# Fundamentals of Intelligence System Projects  

This repository contains projects completed for the **Fundamentals of Intelligence Systems** course at **KN Toosi University**. The projects cover various topics in intelligent systems, including **Fuzzy Logic, ANFIS, Neural Networks**, and their mathematical foundations.  

## Topics Covered  
- **Fuzzy**
- **ANFIS**
- **Neural Networks**  
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks**  
- **Hopfield Networks**  
- **Mathematical Foundations & Implementation**  

## Implementation  
The projects are implemented using **MATLAB** and **Python**, demonstrating both theoretical concepts and practical applications in intelligent systems.  

## Final Project  
The final project, focusing on **building a fuzzy-based system using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**, is available in a separate repository:
